        <h3>Director Spotlight: Christopher Nolan</h3>
        <img src="./images/christopher nolan.jpg" height="400px" alt="Christopher Nolan Picture">
        <p>When asked about his upcoming movie "OPPENHEIMER", Christopher Nolan says "I think recreating the Trinity test [the first nuclear weapon detonation, in New Mexico] without the use of computer graphics, was a huge challenge to take on." He adds "Andrew Jackson - my visual effects supervisor, I got him on board early on - was looking at how we could do a lot of the visual elements of the film practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself, to recreating, with my team, Los Alamos up on a mesa in New Mexico in extraordinary weather, a lot of which was needed for the film, in terms of the very harsh conditions out there - there were huge practical challenges." </p>
